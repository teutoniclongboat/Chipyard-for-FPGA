This repo is FPGA development playground base on UC-berkeley Chipyard.

The next works are going to build Gemmini SoC into your FPGA.
See these repositories:

1. Build RoCC accelerator (but not gemmini) into zedboard: https://github.com/meton-robean/deca
2. Build Gemmini SoC into ZCU102: https://github.com/KireinaHoro/rocket-zynqmp
